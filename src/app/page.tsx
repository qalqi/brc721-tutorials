        <p>
          Before you take the plunge and deploy your first collection with
          BRC721, we strongly recommend introducing yourself with the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.brc721.com/specification" target="_blank">
            specification.
          </a>{" "}
          Taking the time to understand the main technical aspects will help
          build a simple mental model and will significantly improve your
          understanding of the protocol.{" "}
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Basics</h2>
        The protocol consists of three types of manifests:
        <p>
          <span className="block mb-2 font-medium">üìú Collection Manifest</span>
          This is the definitive source of information for your collection. It
          contains essential data such as max supply, max per address, and max
          block height. Consider this manifest as an immutable contract on
          Ethereum.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="block mb-2 font-medium">üëÅÔ∏è Reveal Manifest</span>
          This is a reliable source for your metadata. BRC721 relies on the
          ERC721{" "}
          <a
            href="https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure"
            target="_blank"
          >
            metadata standard
          </a>
          . The metadata is stored off-chain and linked to the collection.
          Similar to ERC721 baseURI and tokenURI properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like in ERC721, you have the option to update the metadata URL to
          incorporate a reveal mechanic. This is achieved by deploying another
          reveal manifest with a higher priority. This priority is controlled by
          the weight field in the manifest.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="block mb-2 font-medium">
            üíé Inscription Manifest
          </span>
          The inscription manifest functions similarly to an NFT token. It
          refers back to the collection manifest. It includes the initial
          owner&#39;s address and price in sats. The initial owner&#39;s address
          comes in handy when you have an allowlist, and you want to restrict
          minting to specific addresses.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Verification</h2>

        <p>
          How do we guarantee the linked nature of all these manifests and
          validate the data? This is where public and private(secret) keys prove
          vital.
        </p>

        <p>
          All the manifests and their content are linked and signed with your
          private key. Our playground can generate them for you. it is important
          to save them in secure storage. You will need these keys to, for
          example, create a new reveal manifest or issue new inscription
          manifests(NFTs). A good practice is to have a separate pair of keys
          for every collection you inscribe and manage.
        </p>

        <p>
          But what happens if someone attempts to cheat? For instance, what if
          someone modifies the inscription price or initial owner&#39;s address,
          or simply refuses to pay for the NFT?
        </p>

        <p>
          If the inscription content is altered, the signature becomes invalid,
          thus breaching the specification. If the payment is not made, it
          constitutes a violation of the specification rules. Consequently, the
          inscription will not be verified and included within the collection.
          The person who made these changes will be left with a worthless text
          inscription. The same outcome awaits anyone trying to mint beyond the
          allowed limit or if the max supply has been reached.
        </p>

        <h2>Inscribing collection</h2>
        <p>
          As previously highlighted, the collection manifest operates as the
          single source of truth for the collection. Its immutable nature
          signifies that it can&#39;t be modified once it has been created.
        </p>
        <p>
          The image below shows that we have declared a collection with the OG
          name and symbol. We have specified my wallet as a payment address to
          receive token payments. In addition, we have set a maximum supply of
          10,000 tokens, with a limit of 5 tokens per address.
        </p>
        <b>
          We encourage you to choose unique name and symbol for your collection
          to avoid duplicates.
        </b>{" "}
        <p>
          We have deliberately left the maximum block height field unfilled.
          This method is suitable for open edition collections, where a defined
          maximum supply is absent, but a time constraint exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>Signer Public Key</strong> field was populated
          automatically because we generated keys beforehand.
        </p>
        <img
          alt="collection manifest"
          src="/images/collection-manifest.png"
          className="p-6 my-8 border"
        />
        <p className="mt-8">
          Now you can press <strong>Inscribe</strong>. It will open OrdinalSafe,
          where you can pay inscription fees and inscribe your collection
          manifest.{" "}

        />
        <p>
          After finishing the above process, you will get a transaction hash
          next to the Inscribe button. This indicates that your transaction has
          been sent.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          By clicking on it, you can see the status of your transaction. In our
          case, it is <strong>Pending</strong>. This indicates that the block
          containing your transaction has yet to be mined. It&#39;s necessary to
          wait until this status updates to <strong>Confirmed</strong>.
        </p>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap my-8">

          </strong>{" "}
          But let&apos;s keep going. Currently, the collection is empty. It
          doesn&apos;t have any tokens or metadata.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Inscribing metadata</h2>
        <p>
          Before users are allowed to mint tokens, we would like to display a
          placeholder for the token&apos;s metadata. Once the minting process is
          completed and all tokens have been purchased, we will replace this
          placeholder with the actual metadata, including various attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
          We&apos;ve prepared an API for this tutorial that returns the token
          metadata by id:{" "}
          <a href="https://brc721.com/api/og/1" target="_blank">
            https://brc721.com/api/og/1
          </a>
          . After the mint, we will use the same endpoint to switch placeholder
          metadata to the real metadata so we don&apos;t have to inscribe a new
          reveal manifest.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, you can inscribe a new reveal manifest with higher weight,
          especially when you store your metadata on decentralized storage like
          IPFS and cannot change the content behind the link.
        </p>

        <p>
          To inscribe your reveal manifest, go to the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.brc721.com/playground" target="_blank">
            Playground
          </a>{" "}
          and fill out the Reveal Manifest form.
        </p>

        <img
          alt="reveal manifest"
          src="/images/reveal-manifest.png"
          className="p-6 my-8 border"
        />

        <p>
          You will notice that we haven&apos;t added the token ids to the
          metadata URL field. It is because the indexer will calculate the token
          id automatically and create the link corresponding to every token.
          Similar to ERC721.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can find your collection inscription id via any Ordinals explorer
          or simply go to our API{" "}
          <a href="https://www.brc721.com/api/collections" target="_blank">
            https://www.brc721.com/api/collections
          </a>{" "}
          and check the latest deployed collections. You will find an object
          like this with all the information about your collection.
        </p>

        <img
          alt="find collection id"
          className="p-6 my-8 border"
          src="/images/find-collection-id.png"
        />

        <p>
          When all the first is filled out, we press <strong>Inscribe</strong>{" "}
          button below the Reveal Manifest form, pay the inscription fees, and
          wait for the transaction to be confirmed.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the transaction is confirmed in a couple of minutes, one of the
          servers will index it and update the collections API so you will see
          your URL.
        </p>

          First, as the collection creator, we will inscribe one token for
          ourselves. The exact process will apply to every access list address
          inscription, but the form should have the price field populated. In
          our case, it is empty to mint for free.
        </p>
        <img
          className="p-6 my-8 border"
          alt="collection owner mint"
          src="/images/collection-owner-mint.png"
        />
        <p>
          To start a public mint, we must specify the price and the collection
          inscription id field. The initial owner address field should be empty.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            Remember that it won&apos;t be possible to pause the public mint.
          </strong>{" "}
          It will end when all the supply is minted. All new inscriptions after
          that won&apos;t be a part of the collection.
        </p>

        <p>
          In those cases, you will have to make a manual refund, we are working
          on a script to fromulate a refund transaction so you can make all
          refunds in a few clicks.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          For public mint, you don&apos;t want to inscribe youself but instead
          <strong> Download</strong>&nbsp;the inscription file and share it with
          your community or submit it to a BRC721 community marketplace.

          In the screenshot below, we have connected the wallet, added the
          inscription file, and clicked the <strong>Inscribe</strong> button. As
          you can see, we need to send the token&apos;s price when inscribing
          it.
